# ME3: Multiplying Binomials

## Problem Statement

Given three binomials, the goal of this exercise is to compute for the product of the three binomials.

## Input

Input starts with a number $N$ and is followed by $N$ set of $6$ integers $(a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3)$ (pertaining to $a_ix+bi$).

## Output

The output is the product of the three binomials, presented as $p_3, p_2, p_1, p_0$ (pertaining to $p_3x^3+p_2x^2+p_1x+p_0$)

## Limits

$ 1 < N < 20 $
$ âˆ’100 \le A_i \le 100 $

## Notes

Problems will have test cases that are not listed in their specification. Your solution must produce the right output for these *hidden test cases*.
